# 🧠 All DSA Questions

This repository is my **complete DSA journey** — a collection of every question I’ve solved, documented with **problem descriptions, platforms, and patterns**.

I’m building this as a long-term vault for:
- 🔁 **Revision** — Quick access to all solved problems for brushing up anytime.
- 🧩 **Structuring** — Organized by topic, difficulty, and approach for easy navigation.
- 🧭 **Pattern Recognition** — To spot recurring logic, templates, and problem-solving flows.

## 📂 Structure
Each folder represents a topic, and every problem has its own mini-folder with all necessary details.

**Example:**

/Arrays/<br>
├── Two Sum/<br>
│ ├── README.md (Problem statement + platform link)<br>
│ ├── solution.cpp (Code + explanation)<br>
│ └── notes.md (Insights, patterns, or alternate approaches)<br>
